Assignment 2: Huffman Coding

Description:
	The program can compress and decompress any file using Huffman Coding
	provided huffman.py and bitio.py are provided. util.py is used by 
	compress.py and decompress.py through which user can enter file name from
	the command line to compress or decompress a file respectively.
	Functions:
	read_tree(tree_stream):
    	Read a description of a Huffman tree from the given compresse tree stream
    decode_byte(tree, bitreader):
    	Reads bits from the bit reader and traverses the tree from
    	the root to a leaf.
    decompress(compressed, uncompressed):
    	Reads a Huffman tree from the 'compressed' stream and decodes the rest to
    	write the symbols to the 'uncompressed' stream.
    write_tree(tree, tree_stream):
    	Writes the specified Huffman tree to the given tree_stream
    compress(tree, uncompressed, compressed):
    	Encodes input uncompressed file and flushes the compressesed result.

Running Instructions:
	1. Open the directory containing util.py, huffman.py, bitio.py, compress.py,
	   and decompress.py through the terminal.
	2.To compress, do:
		python3 compress.py filename.ext
	3.To decompress, do:
		python3 decompress.py filename.ext
	
Notes and Assumptions:
	- Input file for decompression has theextension of .huf.
	- Decompressor assumes that compressed file contains None, marking End of
	  file to terminte the loop.
	- In compress() funcition, if there are any partially-written bytes 
	remaining at the end,0 bit is written to form a complete byte.
